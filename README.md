# dev-vs2013
This is a vagrantfile for a development environment using Visual Studio Community 2013. It's based on a windows 10 basebox built with packer which I'll post to another repo (please bug me about it if I forget)

The basebox needs to have chocolatey already installed. It's required to provision the following tools:
- git
- tortoisegit
- notepadplusplus
- firefox
- visualstudio2013-webessentials.vsix (for typescript)
- resharper -version 8.2.3000.5176 (last version i have a license to use)
- ncrunch.vs2013
